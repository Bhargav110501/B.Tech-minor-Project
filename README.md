project  based on monitoring the parameters  in any industry such as fire, temperature and gas leakage.




Nowadays, gas leakage is a major issue in the home and as well as industries. The 
sense of the gas is very low means we can't find it because of human negligence or 
lack of patience or some other external condition. In Industry Weather Conditions 
Places a Major Role, If there is any Changes in Weather of the Machines or 
Equipment Causes Major Damages to the Industry and effects Economy of the 
Industry to protect from this type of Damages are introduce IOT Based Smart 
Industry Weather Monitoring If the gas level is increased, it causes some disaster. 
1, to avoid this disaster in advance, the alternative idea is discussed in this paper. 
The system is developed with embedded sensors, controllers, and some IoT-based 
software. In this system, we are monitoring the detection of LPG gas leakages with 
some alerting features. Some sensors are used to monitor the different parameters 
like Temperature and humidity sensors (DHT22), gas sensors (MQ-6), flame 
sensors (LM 2903), PIR sensors (HCâ€“SR 501), and Wi-Fi module (ESPZ8266). 
The sensors all are collect their information in their respective field and send data 
to the Wi-Fi module and it will perform. Key Words: Wi-Fi module, sensors. 
It is the Advanced Technology where we can Monitor Weather in the Industry from 
any where in the World by Using IOT Technology this System Collects the 
Weather Parameters from Sensors and Updated in thingspeak.com using http 
Protocol.
